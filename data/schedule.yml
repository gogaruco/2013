    title: "Nokogiri: History, Present, and Future"
    description: >
      Over the past few years, Nokogiri has slowly eclipsed older XML parsing libraries to garner nearly 12 million
      downloads from rubygems.org. But why another XML parsing library? Isn't it boring? And what does "nokogiri" mean in
      Japanese, anyway? These questions will be answered, and I'll do a brief dive into all the technologies that we use
      to make Nokogiri a fast, reliable and robust gem.

    title: "Let's Write an Interpreter!"
    description: >
      Let's dive into one of the the deep ends of CS and implement a turing-complete interpreter in just 30 minutes using
      ruby, ruby_parser, sexp_processor, and a minor amount of elbow grease.

    title: Ruby On Robots Using Artoo
    description: >
      The robotics revolution has already begun. You can buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores.
      Unfortunately, itâ€™s hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate
      multiple different kind of devices. Introducing Artoo, a new robotics framework written in Ruby. Artoo can
      communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices, and integrate them together. With surprisingly few lines
      of code, you can write interesting applications that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more&hellip; even
      all at the same time! The time has come for Ruby-based robotics, and Artoo can help lead the way!

    title: The Littlest ORM
    description: >
      Ever wonder how Sequel, ActiveRecord or DataMapper work? Let's build a working mini-ORM, complete with an
      application and tests! Ruby makes it surprisingly easy. We'll go over all the code in 30 minutes. There will be a
      GitHub link so you don't have to type furiously.

    title: Built to Program
    description: >
      James Edward Gray II has been programming long enough to learn a thing or two about how this computer stuff actually
      works. Nobody cares about that. Seriously, that's not the most common thing people ask him about. Instead, they
      often come with questions about why James tools around in an eletric wheelchair. Were legs just not hackable enough
      for his taste? Does he have a Charles Xavier complex? Does he not eat enough beta-carotene? James is ready to answer
      all of these questions. He believes the answers might even be just a little related to programming. Don't be
      surprised if you find yourself wishing for some neuromuscular disease of your very own. (Note: live genetic
      engineering is a violation of GoGaRuCo's insurance policy, but James can teach you how to fake a disability for the
      purposes of gaining deeper insight into code&mdash;allowable due to the Reprogrammed Humans for the Greater Good Act
      of 2442.)

    title: "Seeing the Big Picture: Quick and Dirty Data Visualization with Ruby"
    description: >
      Data is a hot buzz word in the industry. Every day there are more startups with "Big Data" somewhere in their
      elevator pitch. There are dozens of devices to record how we sleep, what we eat, how much we exercise, even how
      often we breathe. Every action we take online generates data that is stored and analyzed. Understanding all this
      data can be difficult. Humans aren't designed to see patterns in thousands of lines of json or XML. We are good at
      seeing patterns in pictures, graphs, diagrams, and spots in the underbrush. Often a simple visualization is what you
      need to understand a problem. In this talk, I'll demonstrate tools that you can use to quickly generate
      "back-of-the-envelope" visualizations from a variety of data sets.

    title: "Being Human: A Collaborative Approach to Making"
    description: >
      Hey, nerds. How good are you at real collaboration? I don't mean cooperation, where everyone's doing their part. A
      collaborative solution is more than the sum of those parts. And I don't mean choosing the best idea among the
      competitors. Collaboration lets us create new ideas that none of us could have come up with on our own. Let's talk
      about what gets in the way of that kind of juice. Open up, make mistakes, learn, grow, and watch what emerges when
      we collaborate.

    title: Solving The Rubik's Cube in 20 Seconds
    description: >
      Come to San Francisco as a Rubyist, leave as a speedcuber. We are going to use Ruby, a video camera, and an insane
      amount of live demonstration to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds. You will leave this
      talk knowing which cube to buy, which of the five most popular solving methods you should be learning, how to
      practice for speed, where to ask questions, and how Ruby can help teach you to be the fastest speedcuber in town.
      People are solving the Rubik's Cube quicker today than any time in history and there's a reason why.

    title: Why hasn't Ruby won?
    description: >
      <p>For every enthusiastic attendee at a Ruby conference, there are a hundred people who have tried Ruby and walked
      away. There's also at least one person who's hit the top of Hacker News complaining about it. Are missing features
      or poor performance chasing people off? Is the community too international, or not responsive enough on GitHub?
      Maybe the problem is the ones who walk away &mdash; the inexperienced masses, poisoned by Flash, Visual Basic and
      PHP.</p>
      <p>Languages and frameworks are interesting things. When you're choosing one, it's important to consider social
      information about your team &mdash; and the project you're evaluating &mdash; before making a decision. But while
      every README has bullet points listing the project's technical features, it's much more challenging to identify and
      extract the right social data to help that evaluation process.</p>
      <p>Let's bring this missing information into the light and look at social data from real teams, real projects and
      real extracted code. We'll make better decisions. We'll understand why Hacker News exists. Everyone wins! And you
      still don't have to do Flash.</p>

    title: Measuring Ruby
    description: >
      This talk will explore various techniques for measuring performance of Ruby apps. It will cover a wide set of tools:
      from Sam Saffron's own <a href="http://samsaffron.com/archive/2013/03/19/flame-graphs-in-ruby-miniprofiler">Flame
      Graphs and MiniProfiler</a>, to <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/rblineprof">rb-lineprof</a>, and <a
      href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/7453c53b08655e9d17c0419716ffad1c41663b6d#test">recent MRI commits</a> that
      provide better information on object space allocation that will appear in Ruby 2.1. The talk will be highly technical.
