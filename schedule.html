<h3>Session Descriptions</h3>

  <div class="session" id="yehuda-katz">
    <h4>Keynote: On Building Frameworks</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#yehuda-katz">Yehuda Katz</a></p>
    <p>
      Framework development comes with a whole different set of tradeoffs than application
      development. While code in applications is usually in service of a consumer-facing feature,
      framework code is by definition used by other developers writing unknown code. That means a
      heightened focus on architecture, code reuse, and developer usability. That said, as
      applications grow in complexity, parts of the codebase end up looking a lot like frameworks,
      mostly servicing code written by the application developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, Yehuda will cover some of his principles for building friendly, usable
      frameworks, and talk about how you can apply them to your application codebase as it grows in
      complexity over time.

    <h4>Keynote: Writing your own programming language to understand Ruby better</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#jose-valim">José Valim</a></p>
    <p>
      In this talk, José Valim will share what he has learned about Ruby through writing a
      small programming language. He will discuss the basic structure of a programming
      language, suggest improvements and debate about Ruby's parser, object model,
      methods, iterators and blocks.

  <div class="session" id="tim-anglade">
    <h4>CouchDB &amp; Ruby: You're Doing It Wrong</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#tim-anglade">Tim Anglade</a></p>
    <p>
      CouchDB is an increasingly common member of the Ruby developer’s toolset. Its flexible model, low
      footprint, REST interface, and wide library support make it a natural choice for many web, mobile,
      command-line, and desktop Ruby apps. As community manager at Cloudant, I can tell you that Ruby is
      the #1 language customers use to access our CouchDB hosting service. But unfortunately, it’s also the
      language where I have observed the highest levels of egregious misuse. Out of the hundreds of Ruby
      production apps that use our service daily, an overwhelming majority are plagued by poor design,
      wasteful queries or inefficient indexing; and as a result, the average response time for our entire
      Ruby userbase is 2–3x higher than in other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond plain misuse, I have also noticed a rampant and severe underutilization of CouchDB; in most
      cases, it's dropped in as a replacement for MySQL and used in the exact same pattern you would a
      single-instance, relational database. CouchDB has much more to offer, and by leveraging some parts of
      its design, I believe it can help the average Rubyist solve very common pain-points or serve very
      common use-cases, from embedded Ruby apps, to mobile applications and of course, web services.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk will explain the best practices that I've observed, tried and implemented, from a large
      pool of examples that includes the customer apps I've helped optimize and debug, as well as my own.
      Due to the necessity of re-explaining some core CouchDB concepts, this talk
      may function as an introduction to CouchDB, but 
      will also contain valuable lessons for the more experienced users.

    <h4>API: Assumptions Probably Incorrect</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#wesley-beary">Wesley Beary</a></p>
    <p>
      Interfaces are not created equal. Upon reaching the summit of a releasable product it is easy to lose
      sight of where you started. The disconnect grows as you explore how to build a bridge from internals
      to end users. Developing interfaces for others is one of the hardest things we do, but thankfully you
      are not alone. I have spent the last two years interacting with and creating interfaces to cloud
      services with fog. By exploring examples we can see patterns and establish best practices for APIs,
      CLIs and even library code.

    <h4>The Problem is Your Ruby</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#jeff-casimir">Jeff Casimir</a></p>
    <p>
      We're facing a tidal wave of rescue projects.  So many developers dive
      into writing Rails applications without building a real foundation in
      Ruby.  Instead we focus on the new whiz-bang features of Rails or the
      hot gem of the week&mdash;missing the awesomeness right in front of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's talk about Ruby and fill in some of the gaps.  This isn't about
      mind-blowing features and crazy metaprogramming, it's about the
      fundamentals that are often overlooked in Rails applications.
    </p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>WTF are modules, anyway?</li>
      <li>Writing utility objects</li>
      <li>Measuring performance</li>
      <li>Everything worth manipulating is a collection</li>
      <li>Rails "features" that Ruby does better</li>
      <li>Bringing science back into development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Master these techniques, and write better applications with better Ruby.
    </p>

  <div class="session" id="david-copeland">
    <h4>Test-drive the development of your command-line applications</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#david-copeland">David Copeland</a></p>
    <p>
      Rubyists love testing, and test-driven-development is becoming <em>the</em> way to write code. But, do
      we do this with our command-line tools? How <em>do</em> you write a test that your awesome application
      cleans up its temp files? How does one make a failing test for a missing command-line option? What's
      the easiest way to check our app's exit codes?
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk will answer these questions with some real-world examples. We'll talk briefly about the
      challenges particular to testing command-line apps, and then dive into some code where we'll show off
      techniques for organizing code for testability, tools for interacting with the filesystem, and how to
      create full-blown acceptance tests for your command-line app. In no time, you'll be able to write your
      command-line apps the same way you write your other code: test-first.

  <div class="session" id="ryan-dy">
    <h4>Ruby/JavaScript and the mobile web</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#ryan-dy">Ryan Dy</a></p>
    <p>
      Demand for richer, more interactive mobile web applications requires tools and frameworks that are as
      intuitive and simple to use as Rails. These new applications are built with JavaScript but still
      require server backends. While there are many new JavaScript frameworks, only a few are suited to
      mobile web applications, and integrating them can be challenging. Development on iOS or Android may
      leverage Objective-C or Java code to take advantage of features on these native platforms. Ruby is an
      excellent tool for quickly building this new generation of applications: either as a JSON translation
      service between a client application and database, or as a stateful web service using websockets. Ruby
      complements these emerging technologies well, letting you rapidly mock up, develop, and deploy modern
      applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this talk is to illustrate how these new technologies and frameworks can be combined to
      make interactive applications, focusing on mobile devices. In JavaScript, I will illustrate how to use
      Backbone.js and Persistence.js to build a client that communicates with a rails backend without a
      persistent Internet connection. In Ruby, I will focus on how to take advantage of caching techniques
      to make mobile clients interact better with server-side APIs. I will also discuss how to integrate
      JavaScript on native platforms to take advantage of iOS or Android features that are not available in
      the Webkit browser. Lastly, I'll discuss how WebSockets and WebGL can be used to take interaction to
      the next level.

    <h4>Sass: The future of stylesheets</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#chris-eppstein">Chris Eppstein</a></p>
    <p>
      Let’s face it. CSS is dumb. There is no such thing as a <em>DRY</em> CSS file and stylesheets are
      often the biggest blemish in an otherwise beautifully coded app. Sass is the future of stylesheets.
      Rails 3.1 includes it by default and the W3C is adding concepts from Sass to CSS itself. This talk
      will cover the rationale behind Sass, the language features it provides, and best practices you can
      apply to start untangling your stylesheets. Chris Eppstein, the creator of Compass and Sass core team
      member will present.

    <h4>KidsRuby: Think Of The Children</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#ron-evans">Ron Evans</a></p>
    <p>
      Forget about JRuby. MacRuby? Forget it. Forget even Rubinius. As cool as each of them is, they are
      old. Like, you know, for adults. Introducing the real future of Ruby: <a
      href="http://kidsruby.com/">KidsRuby</a>&hellip; because the future is about the kids!
    </p>
    <p>
      KidsRuby was born as a fresh approach to the most important problem we as an industry face: who is
      going to maintain our code in its old age? Most of us in the Ruby community are aware that it is a
      great time to be a programmer. However, it's not so great to be some company trying to find an
      experienced programmer to hire. And the problem is only going to get worse, since the state of
      computer programming education is the US and UK is down, even as demand increases. Like becoming a
      master musician, master programmers are not created quickly. Many of the best programmers today
      started when they were young. There have been a number of excellent contributions for teaching kids to
      program using Ruby. The most famous Ruby environment for kids being Hackety-Hack, from _why the lucky
      stiff. However Hackety-Hack is showing its age and inherent limitations, especially if you want to use
      it with any normal gems, or want to contribute to it. Even the 1.0 release suffers from these
      problems. KidsRuby is a real Ruby, so that kids are not treated like second class citizens just
      because they are learning Ruby. It helps to solve a number of the biggest technical problems with
      teaching Ruby to kids. In 30 minutes I will share not just the technology used to build KidsRuby, but
      more importantly the social glue needed to help start out the next generation of programmers with the
      language we all love. It it time for a general call to arms to the Ruby community. We all need to get
      serious now about training the next generation of hackers. After all, think of the children!

    <h4>0-60 with Goliath: Building High Performance Ruby Web-Services</h4>

    <p>
      Goliath is an open source, event-driven I/O framework, much like node.js or Tornado, except that
      Goliath is based on EventMachine, features a Ruby API, and most importantly, does away with the
      asynchronous "callback muck" by utilizing Ruby 1.9's Fibers to preserve the nice synchronous
      look-and-feel of your code&mdash;which makes it easier to write, test, and maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk we will first explore why Goliath was built, and why the combination of Ruby 1.9, Fibers,
      and an asynchronous event-loop is such a powerful combination. We will take a look under the hood and
      work through several "Hello World" examples: streaming uploads and responses, websockets, and the
      general async API use cases. Further, we'll take a brief look at lessons learned from production
      deployments and what we've discovered while building Goliath at PostRank.

    <h4>Go for the Rubyist: Appropriation of Great Ideas in Ruby</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#dave-grijalva">Dave Grijalva</a></p>
    <p>
      The Go programming language, invented at Google, brings a novel new approach to parallel programming.
      With a strong focus on developer productivity and software readability, Go shares a lot of design
      philosophy with Ruby while targeting a different set of problems. Though the use of new language
      primitives, <em>goroutines</em> and channels, Go applications can solve programs in a highly parallel
      fashion without the use of locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk introduces the Go programming language, discusses the innovative parts of the language's
      design, and demonstrates how these concepts can be applied to Ruby.

    <h4>Fast Rails Tests</h4>

    <p>
      Look at your Rails unit test suite. Now <a href="http://screencast.com/t/O2LhGoVSG">look at mine</a>.
      Now look at yours again. Mine are sub-second. Yours aren't. Having a slow unit test suite can hinder
      an effective test-first or test-driven approach to development. As you add tests, the suite starts to
      slow down to the point where you stop running them after each change. Some people even talk about
      multi-minute unit tests suites! Band-aids like spork are just covering up the problem. Test-driven
      development is a major player in keeping your design malleable and accepting of new features, but when
      you stop paying attention to the messages your tests are sending you, you lose this benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, I will go over some techniques for keeping your test suite lean and fast. Along the way,
      we'll discuss the design improvements that come out of these changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, <a href="http://screencast.com/t/O2LhGoVSG">look at my unit test suite</a> again. Yours can be

    <h4>Smalltalk On Rubinius - or How To Implement Your Own Programming Language</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#konstantin-haase">Konstantin Haase</a></p>
    <p>
      Programming languages must be implemented in Java or C, everybody knows this. Sure, a prototype in
      Ruby, but that would be unusable. After all, Ruby is made for web development, right? Hard tasks, like
      implementing a compiler, have to happen in far more manly languages. But wait, the Rubinius compiler
      is written completely in Ruby, and it seems to get pretty decent performance, maybe we can use that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, we will explore the possibilities of using the Rubinius compiler tool chain to implement
      our own programming language targeting the Rubinius VM. We get all the hard work that went into
      Rubinius for free and above all, can do the heavy lifting in Ruby, everyone's favorite programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example we'll use Reak, a Smalltalk implementation running on Rubinius.

    <h4>Failing Fast - Stuff We Should have Done Better at Square</h4>
    <p class="speaker"><a href="/speakers.html#erica-kwan">Erica Kwan</a></p>
    <p>
      I work for a mobile payments company called Square. Square has a great development culture driven by a
      lot of smart people. Part of that culture includes acknowledging failures, figuring out what should
      have been done differently when failures occur, and learning how to fail less in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to discuss the mistakes made when developing a major Rails app feature, the struggle to
      increase test coverage for the Square iOS client, and the consequences of bad architectural decisions
      made when creating a distributed build system. I'll then talk about how each of these were addressed.

      There are lots of reasons to understand distributed systems. Among them are the facts that the
