      <strong>CouchDB &amp; Ruby: You’re Doing it Wrong</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Tim Anglade is a snarky Frenchman who was into Ruby before it was cool. In a previous life, he
      was an independent consultant who designed, implemented and maintained several Ruby apps in
      production, some of them for 5+ years. He now works for a CouchDB Hosting and Analytics company
      called Cloudant and when he’s not helping customers or making bad puns, he can be found
      speaking at conferences such as OSCON, Fosdem, Buzzwords and NOSQL East. In his spare time, he
      created the NOSQL Summer and the NOSQL Tapes (they’re pretty obscure — you’ve probably never
      heard of them).
