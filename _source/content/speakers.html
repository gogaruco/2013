    <p class="normal-text">
      <strong>CouchDB &amp; Ruby: You’re Doing it Wrong</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Tim Anglade is a snarky Frenchman who was into Ruby before it was cool. In a previous life, he
      was an independent consultant who designed, implemented and maintained several Ruby apps in
      production, some of them for 5+ years. He now works for a CouchDB Hosting and Analytics company
      called Cloudant and when he’s not helping customers or making bad puns, he can be found
      speaking at conferences such as OSCON, Fosdem, Buzzwords and NOSQL East. In his spare time, he
      created the NOSQL Summer and the NOSQL Tapes (they’re pretty obscure — you’ve probably never
      heard of them).

      for the last five years. As ringleader of the <a href="http://hybridgroup.com/">Hybrid Group</a>,
      he has been helping clients solve some of

      Conference, Los Angeles Ruby Conference, Conferencia Rails, and TWTRCON. He has been featured in

      <strong>Fast Rails Tests</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough and went
      on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
      pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching,
      learning and just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little,
      software craftsmanship bee. For the past three years, Corey has focused
      his attention on helping developers improve their fundamental software
      design skills through the use of focused-practice events, such as
      <a href="http://www.coderetreat.com/">coderetreat</a>.
      Lately, Corey has been shifting his attention to getting kids excited
      about programming through building games in Scratch.
