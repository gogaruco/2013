      <strong>Fast Rails Tests</strong>

    <p class="normal-text">
      After 12 years of coding for money, Corey Haines said enough and went
      on a year-long, journeyman pair-programming tour. Traveling the world,
      pair-programming for room and board, he spent his time teaching,
      learning and just living as a knowledge-cross-pollinating, little,
      software craftsmanship bee. For the past three years, Corey has focused
      his attention on helping developers improve their fundamental software
      design skills through the use of focused-practice events, such as
      <a href="http://www.coderetreat.com/">coderetreat</a>.
      Lately, Corey has been shifting his attention to getting kids excited
      about programming through building games in Scratch.
      According to Aaron Patterson at RailsConf 2011, "Corey Haines is so
      awesome, his title is his name!"
