      <strong>Session: Test-First Teaching</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Sarah leads a small consulting group, Blazing Cloud, and is working on a mobile-focused
      startup, Mightyverse. She regularly teaches Ruby and Rails with a test-first approach. In
      her spare time, Sarah works to diversify the Ruby on Rails community with a focus on
      outreach to women through the RailsBridge Open Workshop project. In keeping with her belief
      that programming is a life skill, she also regularly volunteers teaching programming to
      kids. Sarah used to be active on the OpenLaszlo core team before she became distracted with
      Ruby. You can blame her for some of the web's most annoying and least testable features,
      since she was largely responsible for bringing Shockwave and Flash video into the world. She
      blogs at ultrasaurus.com and tweets as @ultrasaurus.

      <strong>Session: Rails is Obsolete (But So's Everything Else)</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Avi Bryant spoke at the first RubyConf, in 2001, then wandered away for a decade to help
      build a web framework (Seaside), product (Dabble DB) and company (Smallthought) on top of
      Smalltalk. When Smallthought was acquired by Twitter, he was abruptly pulled back to both
      Ruby and the Bay Area, and looks forward to enjoying both.
