      <p>
        Tim Anglade is a snarky Frenchman who was into Ruby before it was cool. In a previous life, he

        speaking at conferences such as OSCON, Fosdem, Buzzwords and NOSQL East. In his spare time, he
        created the NOSQL Summer and the NOSQL Tapes (they're pretty obscure&mdash;you've probably never
