      Forget about JRuby. MacRuby? Forget it. Forget even Rubinius. As cool as each of them is, they are old. Like, you know, for adults.
      Introducing the real future of Ruby: <a href="http://kidsruby.com/">KidsRuby</a>... because the future is about the kids!
    </p>
    <p>
      KidsRuby was born as a fresh approach to the most important problem we as an industry face: who is going to maintain our code in its old age?
      Most of us in the Ruby community are aware that it is a great time to be a programmer. However, it's not so great to be some company trying
      to find an experienced programmer to hire. And the problem is only going to get worse, since the state of computer programming education is
      the US and UK is down, even as demand increases. Like becoming a master musician, master programmers are not created quickly. Many of the
      best programmers today started when they were young. There have been a number of excellent contributions for teaching kids to program using
      Ruby. The most famous Ruby environment for kids being Hackety-Hack, from _why the lucky stiff. However Hackety-Hack is showing its age and
      inherent limitations, especially if you want to use it with any normal gems, or want to contribute to it. Even the 1.0 release suffers from
      these problems. KidsRuby is a real Ruby, so that kids are not treated like second class citizens just because they are learning Ruby. It
      helps to solve a number of the biggest technical problems with teaching Ruby to kids. In 30 minutes I will share not just the technology used
      to build KidsRuby, but more importantly the social glue needed to help start out the next generation of programmers with the language we all
      love. It it time for a general call to arms to the Ruby community. We all need to get serious now about training the next generation of
      hackers. After all, think of the children!

    <h4>Keynote: (Parenthetically Speaking)</h4>
    <p class="speaker">Jim Weirich</p>
    <p>
      In any discussion on how to improve your programming skills, one book gets more recommendations than any other: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. SICP was the introductory computer science text at MIT for many years. But how much could a professional developer really learn from a first year CS book?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last fall I embarked on an adventure and invited folks to join me in a weekly study of SICP. We worked the examples and compared our answers. I am here today to share what mind-blowing concepts we discovered in just the first two chapters of SICP. Expect to see some Ruby code like you've never seen before.

    <h4>Test-First Teaching</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Sarah Allen, Alex Chaffee</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've all learned that writing tests before code is a great way to develop software. It turns out that it's also a great way to learn how to develop software in the first place! In this talk we discuss a number of projects that have used test-first approaches to teach Ruby, including Ruby Koans, RailsBridge Workshops, Wolfram Arnold's BFT (behavior-first teaching), Blazing Cloud JavaScript and Rails classes, plus our own open-source Learn Ruby TFT (test-first teaching) curriculum (at testfirst.org). Come hear about our experiences or share your own.

    <h4>Rails is Obsolete (But So's Everything Else)</h4>

      Back in the old days, you submitted a form to some URL and you got back some HTML. These days, you probably didn't hit submit, your URL probably didn't change, and what you got back was probably JSONâ€”but you never saw it because it came in asynchronously in the background. Best practices around web applications are changing fast, driven by new browser standards, sophisticated JavaScript libraries and super fast JavaScript implementations. Why would a web framework design from 2004 still be appropriate? What can we be doing to adapt, or reinvent, our approaches to building web apps?
