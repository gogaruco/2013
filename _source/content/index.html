  Posted June 16, 2011</p>

  <p class="normal-text">After last year's smashing success, we knew it was time to grow! After a long and arduous search, we've got our new dates and venue all settled up: we'll be at the beautiful Mission Bay Conference Center at UCSF on September 17 and 18. The facilities are state of the art with plentiful power and comfortable seating, the location is just a short MUNI ride from downtown, and it can accommodate a bigger batch of attendees.</p>
