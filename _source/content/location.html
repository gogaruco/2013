  an open bar. A shuttle will be provided from the conference to ThirstyBear for those of you who

<h4>Lodging</h4>
<p>
  If you're looking for a place to stay, you might try one of these hotels listed here. There
  aren't any good places to stay near the conference center, so we recommend staying in the Union
  Square / Downtown area. It's easy to take MUNI to the conference from any of the Market Street
  subway stations.
</p>
<p>
  GoGaRuCo has no official connection to any of these hotels, and there is no conference rate
  being offered. We're just providing this list as a convenience to help visitors.
