    <h4>Leah Silber</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">
    If you've been to a Ruby or jQuery conference in the last few years, you've likely seen Leah
    there. When she's not traveling the world seeking out the perfect conference, she's here in
    San Francisco working on other open source community projects, like the Ruby Summer of Code.
    She is currently employed by appendTo.</p>

    <h4>Josh Susser</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Josh likes to say that Ruby is the love child of Lisp and Smalltalk, raised by Perl the
      eccentric nanny. At Pivotal Labs he spends most of his time developing Rails web
      applications for clients, and he is a high-ranked contributor to the Rails open source
      project. He has spoken at RailsConf, regional conferences and meetups. In past lives he's
      done Smalltalk VM implementation, spent too much time at Apple building the ill-fated
      OpenDoc, and helped design the Java VM that runs on the SIM card in your iPhone. You can
      find his blog at blog.hasmanythrough.com.

    <h4>Jim Meyer</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Jim Meyer (@purp) is a perpetual n00b who blames both Ruby and Rails for his sleep deficit
      dating back to May of â€˜07. He's particularly delighted to join a community where agility is
      valued, iteration is key, and testing is cool.
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      With a career that's ranged from freelance graphic design to large scale distributed
      computing systems architecture to leading technology organizations large and small, Jim is a
      renaissance man, a geek of all trades, or (most likely) an advanced case of ADD in search of
      the next challenging distraction. Along the way, he's founded a graphic design studio, built
      technology groups and solutions for the likes of Disney and DreamWorks, met many interesting
      people and had a metric ton of fun.
    </p>
    <p class="normal-text">
      Jim is the father of two and husband of one, all three of whom make him a better person on a
      daily basis (and none of whom speak in third person).
