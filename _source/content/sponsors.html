    We partnered with our first utility client in 2007 from a rented desk in San Francisco. Since
    then, we've grown into a well-capitalized business with over 200 employees and a product
    platform that now reaches more than 10 million homes in North America. Our all-star team of
    software engineers, product specialists, behavioral scientists, statisticians, marketing
    experts, infographic designers, and efficiency advocates are directly responsible for the
    enormous positive impact we've had to date: we've cumulatively saved Americans more than $35
    million and enough energy to power nearly 50,000 homes in perpetuity&mdash;equivalent to one-third
